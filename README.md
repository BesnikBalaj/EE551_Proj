## PROJECT CONCEPT:

Music Recommendation Proof of Concept via Yahoo Data from Kaggle.

Yahoo once hosted a music recommendation challenge in which it asked coders to determine the top 3 songs per user to recommend in the future by only looking at historical data. This notebook consists of code offering a view on one method (of many) that can be done to reach a score of 87% on said challenge or similar ones incorporating shared score methods (nearest partner) as well as a Bottom Up Approach.
